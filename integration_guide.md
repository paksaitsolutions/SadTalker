## 6. Train the integrated model

*   Prepare the training data (videos and images with corresponding audio and body pose data).
*   Implement a training script to fine-tune the GRU-based WGAN and the animation components of `SadTalker`.
*   Define the training parameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, etc.).

## 7. Evaluate the generated videos

*   Evaluate the generated videos using metrics for realism, lip sync accuracy, and gesture naturalness.

This documentation provides a high-level overview of the integration process. The specific implementation details will depend on the chosen gesture generation model and the available training data.
